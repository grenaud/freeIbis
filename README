  freeIbis - Improved Base Identification System
=================================================

* Documentation 
See https://github.com/grenaud/freeIbis/ for a detailed description and our 
wiki (https://github.com/grenaud/freeIbis/wiki) documentation.

* INSTALLATION

In the same folder as this README, there are also three other folders, 
run the following commands:

$ make

This should build the required binaries for freeIbis.

You may now edit params.py in the current directory to change default values. 
In most cases this is not necessary, however if your /tmp folder does not have 
at least 30 Gb free disk space, you should use another default temp folder. 

Base calling should typically be started using 

./runBaseCalling.py

This should give you the list of options. Ideally, you will only need a few of them.
However, you should check the website above for details.

Enjoy using freeIbis.
